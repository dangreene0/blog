I have to beautiful HP Chromebox G1's at home. One of them is a Jellyfin instance that lets me or anyone watch movies without dumbfounded streaming service hellbent on locking media away. I'm so proud of her. The other one is a Thin Client machine I use to test various operating systems. This week I gave OpenIndiana a try as my daily-driver.
